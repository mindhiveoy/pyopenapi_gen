# OpenAPI Generator Findings

## 1. Missing Model Type File: FoundationModelType
- The OpenAPI spec defines `FoundationModelType` as an enum (string) with values: `llm`, `image`, `tts`, `moderation`, `audio`, `realtime`.
- The generated Python client references `FoundationModelType` in `foundationmodel.py` and imports it in `__init__.py`.
- **However, there is no file named `FoundationModelType.py` or similar in `generated/models/`.**
- This will cause import errors and break the client code.
- **Root cause:** The generator failed to create a Python enum or class for this OpenAPI enum.
- **Required fix:** Ensure the generator creates a Python enum for every OpenAPI enum schema, with correct file naming and import/export in `__init__.py`.

## 2. General Enum Generation
- Other enums (like `AiVendor`, `PricingUnit`, etc.) should be checked for similar issues.
- If any are missing, the generator must be fixed to always generate Python enum classes for OpenAPI enums.

## 3. Import Consistency
- The `__init__.py` in `generated/models/` imports many symbols that may not exist if the generator skips files.
- The generator should only import files that actually exist, or always generate all referenced files.

## 4. Model Type Annotations
- The generated models use type annotations referencing missing types (e.g., `FoundationModelType`).
- This will break type checking and runtime imports.
- The generator should validate that all referenced types are generated.

**Action Items for Generator:**
1. Always generate Python enum classes for OpenAPI enums, with correct file naming (e.g., `FoundationModelType.py`).
2. Ensure all referenced types in models are generated and importable.
3. Validate `__init__.py` imports against actual files.
4. Add tests to the generator to catch missing enum/model files.
