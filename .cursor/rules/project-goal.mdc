# PROJECT GOAL
The generated client must produce Python code that:
Communicates directly with the API as defined by the provided OpenAPI spec.
- Accepts strongly typed input parameters (matching the OpenAPI schema).
- Returns strongly typed responses (matching the OpenAPI schema).
- Supports authentication and lazy loading.
- Uses a system default HTTP implementation by default, but allows the user to inject a custom HTTP class for communication.
- The generated code is fully functional out of the boxâ€”no stubs, placeholders, or manual implementation required for basic API communication.
- The generated client must support code completion and type hints in IDEs (such as PyCharm, VSCode, etc.), leveraging Python's type annotations and docstrings for maximum developer productivity.
- All errors that the client receives from the API must be handled by raising an exception; only successful responses are returned as response types.
